## 1. Project Overview
This repository contains code and notebooks for analyzing NYC MTA subway ridership, service alerts, accessibility, and forecasting future demand using big data techniques.

**Key Components:**
- **ridership-analysis.ipynb:** Explores all processed data sources to derive insights into ridership trends, service alert impacts, and accessibility patterns. Includes time-series visualizations (rush-hour peaks, midday troughs), alert frequency histograms, and GeoPandas maps of ADA compliance.
- **big-data-project.ipynb:** Trains and evaluates an XGBoost regression model for daily ridership forecasting. Implements hyperparameter tuning (randomized search), model evaluation metrics (R², RMSE), and SHAP-based global and local feature importance analyses.

-  **Dashboard:**

## 2. High-Level Code Logic
1. **Data Preprocessing**
 ### Loading:
 ● Leveraged PySpark for handling large datasets and efficient sampling.
 ● Example: Sampled 1% of the "Hourly Ridership Data" for exploratory
 analysis to manage memory usage and improve computation speed.
 ### Cleaning:
 ● Removedduplicates to ensure data integrity.
 ● Handledmissing values to avoid inconsistencies in analysis.
 ● Standardized column names for uniformity across datasets.
 Transformation:
 ● Created ageosphere for mapping geographic locations using latitudes and
 ### longitudes.
 ● Calculated and added a distance parameter derived from geosphere calculations to analyze ridership patterns relative to location.
 ● Derived newfeatures, such as:
 ○ "DayofWeek"forunderstanding weekly ridership trends.
 ○ "HourofDay"for analyzing peak and off-peak usage.
 ### Merging:
 ● Integrated multiple datasets by utilizing key attributes:
 ○ Station Complex ID for unifying station-level data.
 ○ Transit Times for detailed ridership analysis.
 ○ AgencyInformation for merging ridership datasets.

2. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Use Jupyter notebook to analyze hourly/daily ridership patterns.
   - Visualize service alert frequency and impact on ridership.
   - Map ADA-compliance gaps with GeoPandas.

3. **Model Training**
   - Load processed data into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Split into training and test sets.
   - Train an XGBoost regressor with hyperparameter tuning (randomized search).
   - Evaluate R² and RMSE on test set.

4. **Interpretability**
   - Compute SHAP values on a stratified sample.
   - Generate feature importance plots and local explanation examples.

## 3. Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Git**

## 4. Installation and Running the Project
1. Clone the repository:
2. Download the data
3. Run both of the ipynb file,by setting the correct path of data. (Since data is too huge to upload it on github.)
